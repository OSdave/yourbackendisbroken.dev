Welcome to this tutorial!

We have tried to make it easy for you to browse this git,
the following commands are available for you:

- bin/next: moves to the next step of this tutorial
- bin/previous: moves to the previous step

The API is running on http://localhost:3000 and you'll find its
logs in /tmp/api.logs

Go back to your browser, you are ready for "Step 1" of the tutorial.
